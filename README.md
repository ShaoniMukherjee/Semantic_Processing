# Semantic_Processing
This is the entire repository for Semantic Processing.

Semantic processing is about understanding the meaning of a given piece of text. But what do
we mean by 'understanding the meaning' of text?
To study semantics, we first need to establish a representation of ‘meaning’. Though we often
use the term ‘meaning’ quite casually, it is quite non-trivial to answer the question “What is the
meaning of meaning, and how do you represent the meaning of a statement?”
Thus, the first step in semantic processing is to create a model to interpret the 'meaning' of text.
There are objects which exist but you cannot touch, see or hear them, such as independence,
freedom, algebra and so on. But they still do exist and occur in natural language. We refer to
these objects as 'concepts'. Terms act as handles to concepts and the notion of ‘concepts’ gives
us a way to represent the ‘meaning’ of a given text.
But how do terms acquire certain concepts? It turns out that the context in which terms are
frequently used make the term acquire a certain meaning. For example. the word ‘bank’ has
different meanings in the phrases ‘bank of a river’ and ‘a commercial bank’ because the word
happens to be used differently in these contexts.
